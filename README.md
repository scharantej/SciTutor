 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a science tutoring website. The website should allow students to find tutors, schedule tutoring sessions, and track their progress. The website should also provide resources for students, such as practice tests and study guides.

## Design

The website will be built using the Flask framework. Flask is a Python microframework that is well-suited for building web applications. The website will consist of the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: The home page of the website.
* `tutors.html`: A page that lists all of the tutors available.
* `schedule.html`: A page that allows students to schedule tutoring sessions.
* `progress.html`: A page that allows students to track their progress.
* `resources.html`: A page that provides resources for students, such as practice tests and study guides.

The website will also have the following routes:

* `/`: The home page.
* `/tutors`: A route that lists all of the tutors available.
* `/schedule`: A route that allows students to schedule tutoring sessions.
* `/progress`: A route that allows students to track their progress.
* `/resources`: A route that provides resources for students, such as practice tests and study guides.

## Implementation

The website can be implemented using the following steps:

1. Install Flask and the necessary dependencies.
2. Create a new Flask application.
3. Create the HTML files for the website.
4. Create the routes for the website.
5. Test the website.
6. Deploy the website to a production server.

## Testing

The website can be tested by manually testing each of the routes. The website can also be tested using an automated testing framework, such as Selenium.

## Deployment

The website can be deployed to a production server using a variety of methods, such as Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform.
